# MIME Types

A set of custom and unofficial mime types for `xdg-mime`. Based on [`shared-mime-info`](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xdg/shared-mime-info)
repository to keep some custom MIME types localized.

## Features

- Implemented experimental / unofficial TypeScript MIME Type
  (`application/x-typescript`; based on JavaScript MIME type).
- Improved README MIME Type to make it detect other popular file names
  as well (`text/x-readme-extended`; based on original README MIME type).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Execute `install.sh` BASH script.
3. Get yourself a coffee ☕️... or better not, installation is so fast that
   you will probably not even make it before it finishes.
4. Logout and login to see changes for your current user.
5. You're done! Enjoy extended MIME support 😄️.
